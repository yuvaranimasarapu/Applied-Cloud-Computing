    "This notebook consists of instructions, exercises and questions that form the practical part of Lab II, Part I. In this assignment, you will learn the basics of the OpenStack Python APIs that can be used to interact directly with the IaaS services Keystone (Identity), Glance (Image) and Nova (compute). Please prepare your solution and answers to questions directly in this notebook, and export it to PDF. Upload that PDF as to the student portal to complete Part I of the Lab.  "
